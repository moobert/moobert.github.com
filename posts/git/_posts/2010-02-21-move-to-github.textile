title: Move to github
---

I first heard about using GIT with SVN at last year's PHPNW conference. After trying out git-svn for projects at work and seeing its feature base and speed over svn, git became the ideal version control for myself. Anyway cut to today and I've moved my blogging attempts to be managed by git itself, using the "pages.github.com":http://pages.github.com feature.

The github pages hosting allows you to create a site in a templating language similar to Django (and various markup languages), and then have its contents compiled into static pages. The compile step uses a Ruby script called "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll, but you can also just upload standard static HTML pages. 

It's interesting to see we have come full circle in a way as it's space year 2010, and site creation using static pages is back.

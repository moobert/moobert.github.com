title: braking up git branches
---

I've recently needed to divide a branch into two parts. The process involved checking out at the commit at the point I wished to divide at and then creating a new branch at this point. The last step was then just a matter of renaming the new branches to fit the name scheme I wanted.

One important thing to note is when doing this as mentioned in the guthub "rebase guide":http://learn.github.com/p/rebasing.html “do not rebase commits that you have pushed to a public repository” as when you make any changes to git's history as you are abandoning existing commits and creating new ones that are similar but still different.

{% highlight bash %}
# make sure we are on master
$ git checkout master

# checkout brake point commit and make a branch
$ git checkout <commit-sha1 /> -b master-old

# rename batches
$ git branch -m master new-change
$ git branch -m master-old master
{% endhighlight %}
